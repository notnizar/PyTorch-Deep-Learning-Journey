# PyTorch Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning PyTorch and Machine Learning. Here, I'll be exploring various concepts, implementing different models, and documenting my progress.

## Current Progress

### Tensor Basics
- Understanding PyTorch Tensors - the fundamental building block of neural networks
- Working with different tensor types:
  - Scalar tensors
  - Vector tensors (1D)
  - Matrix tensors (2D)
  - Higher dimensional tensors
- Creating tensors:
  - Random tensors
  - Zero tensors
  - One tensors
  - Range tensors
- GPU availability checking for potential CUDA acceleration

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Tensors.py          # Basic tensor operations and manipulations
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch

## Learning Goals
- [x] Understanding PyTorch Tensors
- [ ] Neural Network Basics
- [ ] Building Simple Neural Networks
- [ ] Working with Datasets
- [ ] Training Models

## Getting Started
To run these examples, you'll need:
1. Python installed on your system
2. PyTorch library installed (`pip install torch`)

## Running the Code
Each Python file can be run independently:
```bash
python Tensors.py
```

## Resources
- [PyTorch Official Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
